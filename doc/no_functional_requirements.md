# Non-Functional Requirements for Manage debt 

Define the system's performance, security, scalability, and maintainability standards.

## Performance & Scalability
* Response Time: The system should respond to API requests within 500ms under normal load and 1s under high load.
* Concurrent Users: The system should support at least 500 concurrent users without degradation
* Batch Processing: Must efficiently handle bulk debt assessments (up to 10,000 transactions/hour).
* Use horizontal scaling to handle growing user demand.
* Support database sharding to distribute client data efficiently.

## Security 
* Store sensitive data (e.g., client financial records) using AES-256 encryption.
* Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3.
* Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for advisors and clients.
* Ensure clients can only access their own financial data.
* Log all system actions 

## Availability & Reliability
* Uptime Guarantee: The system should have 99.9% uptime (maximum downtime of 8.76 hours per year).
* Implement database replication for redundancy.
* System should recover from failures within 5 minutes.
* Data Backup: Perform automated daily backups with a 7-day retention period.

## Maintainability & Extensibility
* Use modular architecture to separate concerns
* Implement unit tests (>90% code coverage).
* Support dynamic configuration of repayment strategies 
* se Prometheus & Grafana for system monitoring
* Alert administrators on API response times exceeding 1s


## Deployment & DevOps
* Use Jenkins for automated testing and deployments
* Use Docker & Kubernetes for containerized deployments.
* Conduct performance & security testing before each release.
